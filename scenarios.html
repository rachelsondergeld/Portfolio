    <h2>Scenarios</h2>

    <section>
    <h3>Scenario 1 - Greg Johnson</h3>

    <p>Greg is trying to donate money to an organization that he found in the newspaper after reading an article, but is not sure if they are using any type of social media, or if they have a formal way of accepting donations. He wants to set up a few weeks of recurring payments to them, so that he feels like he was able to invest something worthwhile, rather than a one-time donation.
    </p>
    <p>As he begins looking online and through social media, he finds similar organizations with the same name, but they are not the local one he had intended to donate to. Greg thinks to himself that there must be some way for him to reach out to them, so he re-checks the newspaper for any other details but comes up empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
        TrueDonor is an app that Greg has never tried before, but decides to give it a shot since one of the main functionalities is the ability to locate local organizations based on the users location-based services and that current location if enabled. As he searches the name, the pop-up appears with the correct name, along with the physical address of the location, the main contact of the organization, and its trustworthiness rating. Greg now has the ability to open the pop-up and learn more about the organization, but has just got a notification on his phone saying that he needs to take his dog for a walk. Now in a time crunch, he “stars” the org’s page to view later under his saved section and will have the time later to make an informed decision on a local group that he could help.

    <h3>Scenario 2 - Yuna Kang</h3>

    <p>Yuna has grown up seeing Facebook posts and Instagram stories asking for donations, and has always tried to help out friends with a few dollars here and there. Now that she has sufficient disposable income as a 27-year-old, she is looking to make more substantial donations towards causes she cares about. Yuna tries to be intentional about which campaigns she would donate to, as she specifically recalls donating to an animal conservation GoFundMe in high school, only to learn that it was actually an unverified scam fundraiser. </p>
    <p>With this one experience, Yuna has become wary of fundraisers shared by her friends on social media, and oftentimes thinks that the money is better put to use if she directly uses it to enact change rather than donating it to an ambiguous charity. Coupled with the notion that she has seen no verification mechanisms on GoFundMe or Facebook fundraising pages, Yuna has decided she will only donate if she is able to either visit the beneficiary site or meet people from the office of the charity.
    </p>
    <p>Having shared her frustrations with her friend, Yuna then learned about the TrueDonor app, which aggregates fundraisers based on category and verifies their legitimacy. Through this, Yuna was then able to identify dozens of charities which appeal to her passions of female empowerment, youth arts and creativity and marine conservation. While Yuna isn’t donating as much as she’d like to, she feels the TrueDonor app has helped make the donation process more efficient, and has provided the key component of veracity which she never found when donating from links she found on social media.

    <h3>Scenario 3 - Delaney Short</h3>

    <p>Delaney is a 41-year-old stay at home mother, who has recently moved into a more affluent area. She wants to make social connections and advance those relationships by becoming publicly (and tactfully) involved in charitable giving. She doesn’t have a lot of experience making donations, but she is very comfortable with online shopping, and the process of making transactions online. She has mixed feelings about the optics of Facebook’s personal fundraiser option. While it is helpful in signaling her support for these charitable causes, she feels like making her own personal fundraiser, where she is asking others to donate to reach a total, might make her seem like she’s ‘trying too hard.’
    </p>
    <p>Using the TrueDonor app, Delaney has options on how she wants to share about charitable giving that best reflects her sensibilities. Because TrueDonor provides general and reputability information about various charities, Delaney can share information detailing the type of work these charities do, or about her donation to her social media accounts from the TrueDonor app. Delaney feels like providing a link to “learn more” about a cause on her social media flatters her, whereas asking friends to donate to different causes regularly (via Facebook Giving) would be intrusive.</p>
    <p>TrueDonor also helps Delaney quickly and easily become more informed about what types of programs various charities offer. This allows Delaney to better understand and quantify the impact of her charitable giving. This feature also helps Delaney have something to talk about with the other moms involved in charity-work she recently met, without taking too much time out of her busy schedule. Because Delaney is so busy with her kids, she also enjoys using the auto-pay/recurring donation feature. It enables her to be continually involved in charitable giving, without having to worry about it once it’s set up.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>

    <p>When creating the scenario regarding Greg Johnson’s first interactions with TrueDonor, and in the manner that it was, we wanted to create a realistic approach to donating online, and having a user in a time-crunch, on their phone trying to research something is a probable example of how an interaction would go. The design of the application itself would allow a user to browse even without a login, but would need to login in order to use the “save for later” feature. The information provided to the user when initially typing into the search would give very limited, but crucial information like what was described within the scenario. We thought it was a good representation of what a common use case would be for someone like Greg. 
    </p>
    <p>In creating the secondary persona of Yuna, the main component we had to assess was how someone who is not a college student but still in this generation perceives donations with disposable income they are beginning to realize. With this, based on some of the interviews our group conducted, we’ve found that the veracity and authenticity of campaigns are primary drivers in the donation process for younger audiences, who are familiar with online scams and phishing across social media. Since users like Yuna primarily rely on technology and have grown up throughout the prevalence of smartphones, we did not view as steep of an adoption curve for the TrueDonor application beyond understanding of basic functionality, which lends well towards the second use case once Yuna understood how the application functioned.
    </p>
    <p>In the creation process of the scenario for Delaney Short, we decided to concentrate on the connection between social media and charitable giving, due to the impacts discussed in the persona reflection. Within the scenario, we highlighted the ways in which the design of fundraising/charity-awareness social media posts could allow for additional options and greater flexibility, which could in turn drive increased posting and engagement. We thought it was important to examine some of the motivations of posting about charities on social media, aside from the obvious desire to do good. We believe the proposed features/additional options would be better tailored to the socially motivating factors that are in part driving these posts. In this scenario, we also mentioned other types of features that might be useful to some users, particularly if they are busy, or less familiar with charitable giving.
