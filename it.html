    <!-- Beginning of IT-->

    <h2>Information Technology</h2>
    <p class="itparagraph">From June 2017 to August 2018, I was an intern in the information technology department of Grand Traverse Resort and Casinos. During my time there, I was able to gain experience with a large breadth of applications and work directly with both software and hardware. </p>
    <p class="itparagraph">One portion of my job was to provide level 1 support to end-users. This included troubleshooting basic computer hardware, software, and printer issues; as well as unlocking accounts and resetting passwords in active directory and iSeries.</p>
    <p class="itparagraph">In addition to providing level 1 support, I worked under our network administrator to implement company-wide projects. I made a significant contribution to a large project that deployed centralized print services to 930 PCs for 100 printers. A part of that project included auditing every machine on the domain for unsupported software and verifying the status of installed applications. I was also able to receive training on the creation of group policies and organizational units in active directory. </p>
    <p class="itparagraph">For another project, I assisted the telecommunications team in upgrading the phone system from Nortel CS1000 to the Avaya IPOffice. My contributions included flashing the firmware, installation and setup, and providing training to users to operate new features of the phone. </p>
    <p class="itparagraph">There are several other projects I worked on during this internship. Some of these projects included working directly with the servers, point-of-sale systems, and numerous business applications. I loved my time as an information technology intern. It acted as a springboard for me to better understand user experience and notice the type of common pain points users have. </p>
